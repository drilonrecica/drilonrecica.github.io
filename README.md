# FrontCover of drilonrecica.github.io

This is my Github.io Landing Page developed with Flutter Web v.1.10

If you want to take a look at the Flutter project and code, you can find it in the "drilonrecica_github_io" directory

The site is also responsive so it can be correctly displayed on different screen sizes.

Here are some screenshots of how the page looks (as of 02.11.2019):
